#Hallelujah

God is good, God bless you, 

i am sorry to ask this as it is a nice service that you provide but i had 
stored only the previous private key generated with you and the last one didn't 
make it through is it possible to send the private key used to generate this? 

Thank you, also we must all repent and believe in the Gospel, that  we are all imperfect compared 
to a Holy God where even not doing the good we know we ought is sin and we fall short of His Glory, 
but also a loving God who is true, wise, and Holy Love, that He sent His only begotten Son Jesus Christ 
who came for the sick and for sinners and not those who think they are well, who was born of a virgin, 
came in the flesh and did many miracles living a sinless life, dying in our place for our sins and 
resurrecting on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, where now God has made Him Lord of Lords, 
call out Jesus Christ is Lord, get baptized in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,  forgive people and 
bear fruit consistent with repentance. As the gate is large and way wide that leads to destruction and many go on it, 
and the gate small and way narrow that leads to life and few find it, therefore we must do everything we can to make 
it through that small gate, and Jesus Christ the Son of God is the way, the truth and the life, and no one comes to 
the Heavenly Father but through Him, who is also humble and noble and heart, and we can come to 
Him when we are weary and He will give us rest, for that is how we bear fruit that brings glory to God, 
to abide in Jesus Christ, and if we do that then we can ask anything in Jesus' name and 
He will give it and this brings glory to God, and He still does miracles today and always will for 
He never changes, but let us follow His command, to love one another even as Jesus loved us, 
for there is no greater love than this, to give one's life for one's friends. 

Thank you again for the service, i appreciate it, i hope to share Jesus and that at some point if 
you are not believers He will grant you repentance and love of the truth as faith in Jesus comes 
from God and not from ourselves, it is a free gift so that no one may boast, as He uses the despised 
of the world to shame the wise. And i hope to make clear the necessity to repent as i was not given 
that understanding and it was confusing when God began to discipline me, it is not about our best 
lives now materially, but about living lives of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit 
being conformed to the image and character of Jesus Christ who is the image of God and in Him dwells 
all the fullness of God, there will be trials in this life but those who trust in Jesus will overcome 
them all praise God in Jesus name! Allright forgive people, cry out to Jesus,  i have even seen Him 
heal my dog of cataracts and there are other witnesses, believe, confess your sins and He will protect you, 
for no one can take His sheep out of the Heavenly Father's hands, God is great :D
